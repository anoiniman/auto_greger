in building primitives, our code is a bit wierd, and I don't know if we can readily take
more than 1 base in base_table right now, because of the none iterator, and maybe
even the standard iterator might have problems with that, just keep this in mind and if
it becomes a problem preemptively fix it

Enventually the print() function will be overloaded and the comms.robot_send function
will be changed so that they ignore things tagged with "debug", because, it actually
consumes quite a bit of power to both print characters and send characters through
the linked network so yeah

Última coisa a verificar na coisa das builds é ver se os special blocks estão a ser gravos
com sucesso, mas não duvido de tal

After some reading I've come to the conclusion that the cause of our power problems 
is in the print (statements) mainly (a lot of screen writing and refreshing, both in
previous text scrolling up and new one being written down) -- and secundarily in
sending network messages (they'll scale with large distances) -- a solution for the first
is re-directing global "print" into a no-op function, a solution for the second is simply
not sending messages (re-directing debug messages into no-op, transmitting only errors,
warnings and responses) and/or to batch them, cost scales with distance? Maybe Idk how
it workds for linked-cards.

found-it:
linked cards work as such:
-(packet.size / 32.0 
+ Settings.get.wirelessCostPerRange(Tier.Two) 
* Settings.get.maxWirelessRange(Tier.Two) * 5)

this is:
packet.size / 32.0 + 0.05 * 400 * 5
assuming a packet.size of 128:
4 + 100 = 104
a base cost of 100 power per message, fortunatly this cost doesn't vary with distance,
100 is very manageable, but it means that a fully charged robot can only send 200
messages before running out of battery, this compares with a move cost of 15, which is
8 times smaller, this means you can move 1600 blocks before running out of power.

This also means that our power issues come from printing and sending too many debug messages
this will be fixed!

Clear && do walls (6x6) space with (7x7) walls?
-> 7x7 space with 8x8 walls

-- ils transmissions and others of the sort should be batched for transmission
-- add option to ifs multiple steps in a row, at least during the first step
