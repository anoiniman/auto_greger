Dear Friend, you got MetaTables completly ballds up, you didn't understand them at all
now you pay the price, and you shall have to re-write some of your code, in particular
the code that deals with MetaTables, fortunatly, my friend, you seem to have implemented
your meta-tables in a way I expect to be fixable by simply treating your "new" and "zeroed"
calls as returning a deep-copy of the original table, something you might remember
you have already implemented.

Good luck to you, you shall need it.

--- Remember to slam "local" on most of your functions because you have inadvertedly been poluting your namespaces I guess?
