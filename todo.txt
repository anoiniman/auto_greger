in building primitives, our code is a bit wierd, and I don't know if we can readily take
more than 1 base in base_table right now, because of the none iterator, and maybe
even the standard iterator might have problems with that, just keep this in mind and if
it becomes a problem preemptively fix it

Enventually the print() function will be overloaded and the comms.robot_send function
will be changed so that they ignore things tagged with "debug", because, it actually
consumes quite a bit of power to both print characters and send characters through
the linked network so yeah

Última coisa a verificar na coisa das builds é ver se os special blocks estão a ser gravos
com sucesso, mas não duvido de tal
