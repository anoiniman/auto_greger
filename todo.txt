in building primitives, our code is a bit wierd, and I don't know if we can readily take
more than 1 base in base_table right now, because of the none iterator, and maybe
even the standard iterator might have problems with that, just keep this in mind and if
it becomes a problem preemptively fix it

Enventually the print() function will be overloaded and the comms.robot_send function
will be changed so that they ignore things tagged with "debug", because, it actually
consumes quite a bit of power to both print characters and send characters through
the linked network so yeah


Uhhh, start debuging starting from where you left the robot, just add some more temporary values
in nav_obj, you know the drill
