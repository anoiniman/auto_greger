GT-Ores, once mined, have way to identify them
Have global inventory tracking be done in the controller, and the robot to 
only track internal inventory, and, instead of the robot keeping track of 
base inventory by itself, have it ask the controller computer for the contents of 
things in storage, and have it send push requests when it adds things to storage,
also have it so the controller manages where things can be stored, in what storage quads
and in what chests inside the quads, etc.

Basically keeping on with the rim-world for minecraft sort of concept

spcecial cases are things like GT-Ores
